    Use of the term originated with software, but has expanded beyond the software sector to cover other open content and forms of open collaboration.</p>

<h3>Origins<a href="www.google.com">[Edit]</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>The term "open source", as used to describe software, was first proposed by a group of people in the free software movement who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term "free software" and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070611152544/https://opensource.org/docs/osd"><sup>(3)</sup></a> Moreover,
   the ambiguity of the term "free software" was seen as discouraging business adoption.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070611152544/https://opensource.org/docs/osd"><sup>(4)</sup></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070611152544/https://opensource.org/docs/osd"><sup>(5)</sup></a><a href="www.google.com">Christine Peterson, Todd Anderson, Larry Augustin, Jon Hall, Sam Ockman, Michael Tiemann and Eric S. Raymond. Peterson</a> suggested "open source" at a meeting[6] held at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070611152544/https://opensource.org/docs/osd">Palo Alto, California</a>, in reaction to Netscape's announcement in January 1998 of a source code release for Navigator. Linus Torvalds gave his support the following day,
    and Phil Hughes backed the term in Linux Journal. Richard Stallman, the founder of the free software movement, initially seemed to adopt the term, but later changed his mind.[6][7] Netscape released its source code under the Netscape Public License and later under the Mozilla Public License.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070611152544/https://opensource.org/docs/osd"><sup>(8)</sup></a></P>

<p>Raymond was especially active in the effort to popularize the new term. He made the first public call to the free software community to adopt it in February 1998.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070611152544/https://opensource.org/docs/osd"><sup>(9)</sup></a> Shortly after, he founded The Open Source Initiative in collaboration with Bruce Perens.<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070611152544/https://opensource.org/docs/osd"><sup>(6)</sup></a>
The term gained further visibility through an event organized in April 1998 by technology publisher Tim O'Reilly. Originally titled the "Freeware Summit" and later known as the "Open Source Summit",<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070611152544/https://opensource.org/docs/osd"><sup>(10)</sup></a> the event was attended by the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects, including <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070611152544/https://opensource.org/docs/osd">Linus Torvalds, Larry Wall, Brian Behlendorf, Eric Allman, Guido van Rossum, Michael Tiemann, Paul Vixie, Jamie Zawinski, and Eric Raymond</a>. At the meeting, alternatives to the term "free software" were discussed. Tiemann advocated "sourceware" as a new term, while Raymond argued for "open source". The assembled developers took a vote, and the winner was announced at a press conference the same evening.[10</P>



<p>Many large formal institutions have sprung up to support the development of the open-source software movement, including the Apache Software Foundation, which supports community projects such as the open-source framework Apache Hadoop and the open-source HTTP server Apache HTTP.</p>
